 * need to tell [AppComponent] that it is going to have all these subcomponents
 * nor do you need to tell these subcomponents that [AppComponent] exists.
 * We are also telling Dagger.Android that this generated SubComponent needs to include the
 * specified modules and be aware of a scope annotation [@ActivityScoped].
 * When Dagger.Android annotation processor runs it will create 2 subcomponents for us.
